I would like to thank the many people without whom this book would not have been possible. A team of
highly skilled people—who I really have enjoyed working with—has greatly assisted me in creating this work.
First, I would like to thank the people at Apress involved in this project. Thanks to Steve Anglin for
coming up with the idea for this book and for his assistance and insight in putting the initial table of content
together. Thanks to project Manager Mark Powers for gently pushing me along and for keeping everything
well scheduled and organized. Your experience and professionalism helped to make the book-writing
process considerably easier than it otherwise might have been. Kezia Endsley, who copy edited the book, I
would like to thank very much for your finely tuned eye and the precision and dedication you applied to the
task. When I saw how many comments you had on each chapter I delivered, I knew this book would be even
better than I had hoped. As a result, this book is not only full of new and interesting insights into NetBeans
IDE, but also concisely written and consistently formulated.
Next, many, many thanks to Josh Juneau. Not sure exactly when I first met Josh, probably at JavaOne
some years ago! He’s an author in his own right and a very focused and technically savvy supporter of all
things NetBeans. The second I was asked to provide a technical reviewer, I thought of Josh. Aside from
many insights and shared wisdom, he’s contributed a large part of the Chapter 9 on profiling and tuning,
with thanks to Andrew Binstock from the Oracle Java Magazine, who let us reuse parts of an article that Josh
published there.
